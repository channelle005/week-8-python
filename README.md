# Iris Dataset Analysis

## Project Description:
This project performs an analysis of the Iris dataset, which contains measurements of 150 iris flowers across three different species. The analysis includes statistical exploration and various visualizations to better understand the relationships between features such as sepal length, petal length, and species.

## Objectives:
- Load and inspect the Iris dataset.
- Compute basic statistics for numerical columns.
- Create various visualizations such as line charts, bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots.
- Explore and analyze patterns in the data.

## Tools and Libraries Used:
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (or Jupyter Lab)

## How to Run/View the Project:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip` (e.g., `pip install pandas matplotlib`).
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells from top to bottom.

## Insights and Reflections:
The analysis reveals interesting relationships between sepal and petal lengths across different species of iris flowers. The project demonstrates how basic data analysis and visualization techniques can be applied to real-world datasets.
